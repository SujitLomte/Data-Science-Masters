    "* 'r' (read only) mode: This is the default mode, which opens the file for reading only.\n",
    "* 'w' (write only) mode: This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated and the file is overwritten. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "* 'a' (append only) mode: This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "* 'x' (exclusive creation) mode: This mode opens the file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file already exists, the open function raises an error.\n",

    "## Ans- The close() function is used to close an open file in Python. Closing a file is important because it ensures that all changes made to the file during its open state are saved and any system resources used by the file are freed up. When a file is not closed, the data may not be properly saved, leading to data loss or corruption, and the system resources used by the file may not be released, leading to performance problems or resource exhaustion.\n",

For example, if a file is opened in write mode and not closed, it cannot be opened again until it is closed, and if it is opened by another program, the data may not be up-to-date."
